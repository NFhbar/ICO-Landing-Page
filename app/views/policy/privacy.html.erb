  <!-- 2. Information collected -->
  <div>
    <h1 class = "text-blue">2. Information collected</h1>
    <p>When expressing an interest in obtaining additional information
    about the Services or registering to use the Services, Oshie may
    require you to provide the Company with personal contact information,
    such as name, company name, address, phone number, and email address
    (“Required Contact Information”). When purchasing the Services,
    Oshie requires you to provide the Company with financial
    qualification and billing information, such as billing name,
    billing address, and credit card number (“Billing Information”).
    Oshie may also ask you to provide additional information,
    such as company annual revenues, number of employees, or industry
    (“Optional Information”). Required Contact Information,
    Billing Information, and Optional Information about Customers
    are referred to collectively as “Data About Oshie Customers.”</p>
    <p>As you navigate the Company’s Web site, Oshie may also collect
    information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering
    tools, such as cookies and Web beacons
    (“Web Site Navigational Information”). Web Site Navigational
    Information includes standard information from your Web browser
    (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol
    (“IP”) address, and the actions you take on the Company’s Web
    sites (such as the Web pages viewed and the links clicked).</p>
  </div><!-- 2. Information collected -->

  <!-- 3. Use of information collected -->
  <div>
    <h1 class = "text-blue">3. Use of information collected</h1>
    <p>The Company uses Data About Oshie Customers to perform the
    services requested. For example, if you fill out a “Contact Me” Web
    form, the Company will use the information provided to contact you
    about your interest in the Services. Also, Customers may elect to
    invite a friend to use Oshie’s Services in a collaborative manner
    (referred to as adding “collaborators”). Oshie must receive the
    email address of the friend, and sends the friend an invitation
    email.</p>
    <p>The Company may also use Data About Oshie Customers for marketing
    purposes. For example, the Company may use information you provide
    to contact you to further discuss your interest in the Services and
    to send you information regarding the Company and its partners, such
    as information about promotions or events.</p>
    <p>Oshie uses credit card information solely to check the financial
    qualifications of prospective Customers and to collect payment for
    the Services.</p>
    <p>Oshie uses Web Site Navigational Information to operate and improve
    the Company’s Web site. The Company may also use Web Site
    Navigational Information alone or in combination with Data About
    Oshie Customers to provide personalized information about the

    <p><h3>Cookies, Web Beacons, and IP Addresses</h3></p>
    <p>Oshie uses commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as
    cookies and Web beacons, to collect information as you navigate the
    Company’s Web sites (“Web Site Navigational Information”).
    This section describes the types of Web Site Navigational Information
    that may be collected on the Company’s Web sites and how this
    information may be used.</p>
    <p><strong>Cookies</strong> - Oshie uses cookies to make interactions
    with the Company’s Web sites easy and meaningful. When you visit the
    Company’s Web site, Oshie’s servers send a cookie to your computer.
    Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely
    recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to
    Oshie, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account,
    or filling out a Web form (such as a “Contact Me” or a
    “30 Day Free Trial” Web form), you remain anonymous to the Company.</p>
    <p>Oshie uses cookies that are session-based and persistent-based.
    Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from
    your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer.
    Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your
    browser or turn off your computer. Please note that if you disable
    your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to
    navigate the Company’s Web sites, but the functionality and features
    of the Services may be affected, and you may not be able to
    successfully use the Services. Similarly, if you disable JavaScript,
    some features of the Company’s Web sites may not function properly,
    and some areas of the Company’s Web sites may not function at all.</p>
    <p>If you have chosen to identify yourself to Oshie, the Company
    uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow
    the Company to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into the
    Services, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier
    that is tied to your account is placed your browser. These session
    cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are
    logged into the Services and to process your online transactions
    and requests. Session cookies are required to use the Services.</p>
    <p>Oshie uses persistent cookies that only the Company can read
    and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the
    Company’s Web site. When you purchase the Services or provide
    the Company with personal information, a unique identifier is
    assigned you. This unique identifier is associated with a persistent
    cookie that the Company places on your Web browser. The Company is
    especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the
    information stored in persistent cookies. For example, the Company
    does not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies.
    If you disable your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you
    will be able to navigate the Company’s Web site, but you will not
    be able to successfully use the Services.</p>
    <p>Oshie may use information from session and persistent cookies
    in combination with Data About Oshie Customers to provide you
    with information about the Company and the Services.</p>

          individuals who visit the Company’s Web site. For example,

          site performance, run tests on the effectiveness of our Web
          sites and marketing efforts, and improve user experience.
          Oshie may use cookies delivered by third parties to track
          the performance of Company’s advertisements. For example,
          these cookies remember which browsers have visited the
          Company’s Web sites. The information provided to third parties
          does not include personal information, but this information
          may be re-associated with personal information after the
          Company receives it. Oshie may also contract with third-party
          advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other
          information from the Company’s Web site, from emails, and on
          third-party Web sites. Ad networks follow your online
          activities over time by collecting Web Site Navigational
          Information through automated means, including through the
          use of cookies. They use this information to provide
          advertisements about products and services tailored to your
          interests. You may see these advertisements on other Web sites.
          This process also helps the Company manage and track the

    <p><strong>Cookies</strong> - Oshie uses Web beacons alone or in
    conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and
    Visitors’ usage of the Company’s Web sites and interaction with emails
    from the Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can
    recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as
    cookies, when you viewed a particular Web site tied to the Web beacon,
    and a description of a Web site tied to the Web beacon. For example,
    Oshie may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company
    when you click on a link in the email that directs you to the Company’s
    Web site. Oshie uses Web beacons to operate and improve the Company’s
    Web sites and email communications.</p>
    <p>Oshie may use information from Web beacons in combination with Data
    About Oshie Customers to provide you with information about the
    Company and the Services.</p>
    <p><strong>IP Addresses</strong> - When you visit Oshie’s Web site,
    the Company collects your Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses to
    track and aggregate non-personal information. For example, Oshie
    uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and
    Visitors navigate the Company’s Web site.</p>
    <p><strong>Do Not Track</strong> - Currently, various browsers –
    including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari – offer
    a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology
    known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites visited
    by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting.
    Oshie does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT
    signals with respect to the Company's Web sites, in part, because
    no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry
    groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent
    standard of interpreting user intent. Oshie takes privacy and
    meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to
    monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the
    implementation of a standard.</p>
